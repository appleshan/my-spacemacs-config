;;; Commentary:

;; A tool like vimdiff for Emacs 

;; ** Introduction

;; vdiff is a diff tool for Emacs that is made to behave like vimdiff, meaning diff
;; information is displayed in buffers as you edit them. There are commands for
;; cycling through the changes detected by =diff= and applying changes from one
;; buffer to the other. 

;; ediff is a powerful diff tool built into Emacs, but it works differently. In
;; ediff you control the diffed buffers through a third control buffer, which works
;; great until you want to edit the buffers directly. I prefer the way vimdiff
;; works, but I am also not necessarily interested in perfectly emulating
;; vimdiff. vdiff does not assume you use evil-mode, but is compatible with it.

;; vdiff is a work in progress, so use it at your own risk. Contributions are very
;; welcome.

;; ** Installation and Usage

;; It will be on MELPA eventually. For now, you have to clone this repository and
;; modify =load-path=. Here's an example =use-package= declaration.

;; (use-package vdiff
;;   :load-path "path/to/vdiff"
;;   :commands (vdiff-buffers vdiff-files)
;;   :config
;;   (define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map))

;; The last line puts the main vdiff commands under the =C-c= prefix. With this
;; declaration the key bindings in vdiff buffers are

;; | Key     | Command                         | Description                                        |
;; |---------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
;; | =C-c n= | =vdiff-next-change=             | Move to next change in buffer                      |
;; | =C-c p= | =vdiff-previous-change=         | Move to previous change in buffer                  |
;; | =C-c g= | =vdiff-goto-corresponding-line= | Jump to the corresponding line in the other buffer |
;; | =C-c s= | =vdiff-send-changes=            | Send this hunk (or all in region) to other buffer  |
;; | =C-c r= | =vdiff-receive-changes=         | Receive the corresponding hunk from other buffer   |
;; | =C-c w= | =vdiff-save-buffers=            | Save both buffers                                  |
;; | =C-l=   | =vdiff-sync-and-center=         | Recenter both buffers at current line              |

;; ** Further customization
   
;; The current customization options and there defaults are
   
;;   ;; Whether to lock scrolling by default when starting vdiff
;;   (setq vdiff-lock-scrolling t)

;;   ;; external diff program/command to use
;;   (setq vdiff-diff-program "diff")

;;   ;; Extra arguments to pass to diff. If this is set wrong, you may
;;   ;; break vdiff.
;;   (setq vdiff-diff-program-args "")

;;   ;; Commands that should be executed in other vdiff buffer to keep lines in
;;   ;; sync. There is no need to include commands that scroll the buffer here,
;;   ;; because those are handled differently.
;;   (setq vdiff-mirrored-commands '(next-line
;;                                   previous-line
;;                                   evil-next-line
;;                                   evil-previous-line
;;                                   beginning-of-buffer
;;                                   end-of-buffer))
